## MovingAveragingFilter
Demonstration of applying MovingAveragingFilter on scan data.
### Description:
Scan data is loaded from a file in the resources directory and the moving averaging filter is applied to that data. The filtered data is displayed and the difference between the original and the filtered scan is evaluated.
### How to run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Output is printed to the console and the scan can be seen on the viewer in the web page.
The playback stops after the last scan in the file. To replay, the Sample must be restarted.
To run this sample, a device with AppEngine >= 2.10.0 is required.
### Implementation
To run with real device data, the file provider has to be exchanged with the appropriate scan provider.
